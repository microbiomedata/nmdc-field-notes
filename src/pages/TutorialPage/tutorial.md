## Soil Package

Are you planning a trip to the field to collect soil samples and metadata? Below we have listed the NMDC soil package required metadata fields to ensure you pack the right tools and make required measurements in the field!

Note: The NMDC metadata requirements also encompass fields required by NCBI and the Genomic Standards Consortium (GSC)


### What to consider bringing out to the field to collect sample metadata
- Way of measuring sampling depth e.g., ruler, measurement device
- Sample storage method (e.g., preservative, cooler, freezer)
- Way of labeling samples (e.g., labeled tubes, sharpies, barcodes); can also bring barcode reader to log sample numbers from barcodes in the app
- Sample collection device (link the things from sample collection device field)
- Thermometer, or way of measuring air temperature and sample temperature
- Way of measuring elevation (e.g.,
- Way of locating sampling point (latitude and longitude)
- Slope aspect?
- Way of collecting pH (e.g., pH strips)


### Basic recommendations for fieldwork
- Bring sunscreen, hat, sunglasses, bug spray
- Tell at least one person where you are going, when you are going, other information about your sampling trip
- Know local animals and dangers they may pose
- Check weather conditions and know risks for local weather events (e.g., flash floods)
- Know risks for injuries in the sampling environment
- Bring plenty of food and water
- Bring communication device(s), know limitations of them (e.g., no cell phone service)
- Proper shoes and clothes for the environment and weather
- Always better to sample with a group or another individual, try to never go alone
- Pack layers of clothing

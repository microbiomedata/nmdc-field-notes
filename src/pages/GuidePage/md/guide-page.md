Are you planning a trip to the field to collect samples? Here is some general guidance for conducting fieldwork with the NMDC Field Notes mobile app.

> **Note**: This guidance is not meant to be exhaustive and there are other considerations for fieldwork. Please consult your institutional policies regarding safety and security in the field and review existing fieldwork guidance.

# How NMDC Field Notes works with the NMDC Submission Portal

The NMDC Field Notes mobile app synchronizes data with the NMDC Submission Portal and vice versa. This means that changes made in one place will be reflected in the other. However, there are a few important considerations to note:

- **Multiple collaborators**. NMDC Field Notes mobile app does not currently allow adding multiple collaborators when creating a study. If multiple people need access to a shared study, create the study in the Submission Portal first with the necessary collaborators before going into the field.
- **Simultaneous modifications**. Similar to the Submission Portal, NMDC Field Notes mobile app allows only one person to modify a given study at a time in order to prevent conflicting updates. Therefore, you will see a warning in the app if you try to edit a study (including adding, updating, and removing samples associated with the study) while it is being edited by another collaborator.
- **Finalizing a study**. NMDC Field Notes mobile app is designed for streamlined sample metadata collection. Once your sample collection is complete, return to the Submission Portal to fill in the final details of your study and submit it to NMDC for review.

# Important details about working without internet access

The NMDC Field Notes mobile app is designed to work with or without internet access (i.e., without Wi-Fi or cellular service). However, there are a few important limitations to be aware of when using it without internet access:

- **ORCID sign-in**. Most features of the app require signing in via ORCID in order to get your NMDC user profile and any existing studies associated with your account. That information will be stored for offline use, but the initial sign-in must be done while you have internet access.
- **Creating and deleting studies cannot be done while offline**. However, studies can be updated (including adding, updating, and removing samples associated with a study) while offline. Please create your study or studies while you have internet access.
- **Once you are back in an area with internet access**, open the Field Notes mobile app again to sync the changes you made while offline with the server.
- **Updating shared studies while offline can lead to data loss**. When using the app without an internet connection, the app cannot know whether a shared study (including its samples) is being edited by another collaborator. The app will allow you to make edits, and it will sync those edits with the server the next time you use the app while online. However, this delayed sync may overwrite edits made by other collaborators while you were offline. If you plan to work in an area with limited or no internet access, consider having each person work on separate studies and manually merge the separate studies together via the Submission Portal at a later time.
- **Backup plan**. Consider keeping a duplicate copy of your sample metadata on paper if possible.

# What to consider reviewing prior to going into the field

- Review the NMDC metadata requirements for your sample type(s) along with standard descriptors/ontologies to ensure you obtain the most accurate observations.
- Obtain topographical and geographical information for your sampling sites if that data will not be measured or recorded while on site.
- Test and calibrate all tools prior to use in the field to ensure proper measurements.
- Review the CARE principles for proper data sovereignty for indigenous land. This figure from the Geological Society of America describes other aspects of [Field Ethics](https://www.geosociety.org/GSA/Education_Careers/GSA/edu-career/fieldethics.aspx?hkey=de4690fb-49ef-460a-8e86-21797ea969d8).

# Basic recommendations for fieldwork

- Bring a hat, sunglasses, sunscreen, and bug spray.
- Tell at least one person where you are going, when you are going, other information about your sampling trip (designate a rendezvous point or time).
- It is always better to sample with a group or another individual. Try to never go alone.
- Know local wildlife and the dangers they may pose, and consider bringing wildlife deterrents (e.g., bear spray).
- Check weather conditions and know risks for local weather events (e.g., flash floods, lightning storms, coast guard warnings).
- Know risks for injuries in the sampling environment and be aware of the symptoms of common stress (e.g., heat exhaustion, frostbite, motion sickness) to mitigate injuries.
- Bring plenty of food and water. Always bring more than you need.
- Bring communication device(s) and know limitations of them (e.g., no cell phone service, finite battery life).
- Bring a battery pack or energy bank if possible.
- Wear or pack proper shoes and clothes for the environment and weather.
- Only sample where you have permission to. Ensure you have all proper permits.
- Have a sampling plan and data management plan written and reviewed prior to going out into the field. Consider how you will label and store your samples and data (e.g., labeling, barcodes, storage temperatures).

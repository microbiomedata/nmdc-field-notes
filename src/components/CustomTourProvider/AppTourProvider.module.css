/**
 * When in dark mode, add a "spotlight" effect to the highlighted element in
 * order to make it stand out from the masked area.
 *
 * Note: By default, in dark mode, the "spotlight" effect (on the highlighted element)
 *       doesn't occur, since our screens already have a dark background in dark mode
 *       (so masking the background doesn't change its brightness by much). So, here,
 *       I added some extra styling in an attempt to achieve a similar "spotlight"
 *       effect in dark mode as that which occurs organically in light mode.

# Decorators

This directory contains [decorators](https://storybook.js.org/docs/writing-stories/decorators#story-decorators)
that developers can apply to stories residing in any directory.

## `ionicContent.tsx`

This decorator wraps a story within some high-level Ionic React elements.
It makes the result look like part of an Ionic app, instead of part of an un-styled web page.

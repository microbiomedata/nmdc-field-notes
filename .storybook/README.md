# Storybook

This directory contains files related to this project's use of 
[Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/docs/get-started/why-storybook).

## `example-stories/`

This directory contains example Storybook stories.
The stories were generated automatically during Storybook initialization.

> When those example stories were generated, they were generated in a different directory.
> We moved them to this directory in an attempt to simplify the file tree. 
> Once developers become comfortable writing stories, we may delete them altogether.
